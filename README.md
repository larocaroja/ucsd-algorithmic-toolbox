This repository contains solutions for [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/home/), a MOOC by University of California, San Diego. Starting from 11st June 2023, I aim to finish this course to build a foundation for my Master's degree at University of California, San Diego before Fall 2023.
